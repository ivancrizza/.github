### 👋 Hi there! 

my name is Ivan and I'm an Android developer 🤓 [@brq](https://twitter.com/brqdigital)  working at [Itaú](https://twitter.com/itau), precisely one of the most beautiful and [lightest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itau.applight&hl=en) projects I've ever worked.👇

It's been a great journey so far 👨‍💻

Not going to lie though, I'm very rookie in terms of programming - I'll complete 2 years of experince - but this craftsmanship it's amazing 💕

I'm also working on a podcast with a few friends about android development here in Brazil 🌅🏖🏳‍🌈
